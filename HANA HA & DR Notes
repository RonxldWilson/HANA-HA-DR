What is High Availability?

Availability is defined as a measure of a system’s operational continuity, which is 
expressed as a percentage of time, inversely proportional to downtime.

Fault Recovery is the process of recovery and resuming system operations after an 
outage in the data center due to a fault.

Downtime is the consequence of outages, which may be planned (e.g. system upgrades) 
or unplanned (e.g. power failures, natural disasters),and brings down the data center 
operations.

Disaster Recovery is the process of  recovering operations after an outage due to a
prolonged data center or site failure, which requires preparations to back up data 
over long distances

High Availability - Overview

Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the maximum tolerable period of time during which operational data is lost without the ability to recover.

Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the maximum permissible time it takes to recover the system after an outage for operations to resume.

As an in-memory database platform: 
SAP HANA maintains the reliability of its data in the event of failures. It resumes operations with most of the data loaded back in memory
as quickly as possible in order to meet the RTO objectives.

Mission-critical application systems are expected to operate with an RPO of zero data loss in the case of local faults or disasters etc.
In order to achieve zero RPO and low RTO, data must be replicated synchronously over longer distances, which impacts regular system 
performance and may require more expensive standby and failover solutions.

All of this leads to tradeoff decisions around the attributes of fault recovery functionality, cost, and complexity.
#########################################################
SAP HANA platform supports the following high availability measures:

#System availability support:
    Host auto-failover: Automatic failover from crashed host to standby host in the same system
    Storage replication: Continuous replication (mirroring) between primary storage and backup storage over a network (may be synchronous)
    System replication: Continuous update of secondary systems by primary system, including in-memory table loading
#Fault recovery support:
    Service auto-restart: Automatic restart of stopped services on host (watchdog)
    Host auto-failover: Automatic failover from crashed host to standby host in the same system
    System replication: Continuous update of secondary systems by primary system, including in-memory table loading
#Disaster recovery support:
    Storage replication: Continuous replication (mirroring) between primary storage and backup storage over a network (may be synchronous)
    System replication: Continuous update of secondary systems by primary system, including in-memory table loading
    Backups: Periodic saving of database copies in safe place
